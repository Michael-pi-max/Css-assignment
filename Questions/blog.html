            <p class="title">px vs. relative styles to achieve responsivness</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Browsers are getting better and better with lots of additional features. Earlier version of browsers
                    had limited features, static websites were popular back then. As browser features matured, relative
                    css units came into existence to meet the needs of changing window sizes.it was clear to choose
                    between pixel and relative style until this point. But the introduction of browser zooming created
                    argument among web developers on the relevance of using pixel over relative style to achieve
                    responsive website.
                </p>
                <h4>what is browser zooming?</h4>

                <p>
                    Browser zooming technically is, when the user zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales
                    up or down proportionally.If there is browser zooming feature to accommodate the changes when the
                    view port is changed. Is relative style still worthy is the main debating point.
                </p>
                <div class="large_box">
                    <div class="static">
                        <h4>Those who reside in using pixel</h4> <br>
                        “Browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don’t have to convert our typography to
                        relative units in CSS. Users don’t bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser,
                        our work is done here!” <br><br>
                        Values defined in pixels make maintenance of code more straightforward. It also makes code more
                        portable as styles can be dropped in to another project without potential sizing compounding
                        issues (em) or needing to adjust values due to different root font sizes (rem). <br> <br>
                        However, most importantly, pixels make working with designers day to day easier. Pixels provide
                        a shared language between the worlds of developer and designer. This shared language makes it
                        easy and accessible for anyone to jump in and change/tweak values in developer tools and get
                        predictable results.
                    </div>
                    <div class="dynamic">
                        <h4>Those who reside in using relative styles</h4>
                        <p>
                            “Yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there’s a difference between how the UI appears
                            when
                            the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser size has been adjusted as well.
                            Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so we need to account for
                            that in our CSS declarations.” <br> <br>
                            If the world were an ideal place, we’d all use pixels. But it’s not, we have the broken
                            browser
                            to contend with. IE/Win will not allow readers to resize text that has been sized in pixels.
                            Like it or not, your readers will want to resize text at some point. Perhaps they are
                            short-sighted, doing a presentation, using a ridiculously high resolution laptop or simply
                            have
                            tired eyes. So unless you know (not think) your audience won’t be using IE/Win or will never
                            wish to resize their text then pixels are not yet a viable solution.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This guideline states that all website text must be resizable (zoomable). This was more of a problem
                    in
                    older browsers from around 2005 where browsers wouldn’t resize text sizes as pixels or points, but
                    that
                    isn’t an issue anymore as all modern desktop browsers will trigger a full page zoom.</p>
                <p>
                    Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200
                    percent without loss of content or functionality.</p>
                <h4>my judgment</h4>
                <p>To achieve responsivness after the emergence of zooming feature of browser, the effect of using pixel
                    is becoming as effective as using relative styles. but I think there are cases where we should
                    prefer
                    one over the other.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> ✔ As indicated above zooming feature makes pixels as effective as %, rem and em on
                                achieving
                                reponsive pages. but there is a condition that does not support this claim. The above
                                claim is
                                stated true
                                provided that that users do <strong> not </strong> dig into the advanced browser
                                settings to
                                change their default font size.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                ✔ A lesser known feature of most browsers, though, is the option to adjust your
                                preferred font size. This feature operates independently from the page zoom
                                feature.ranging from the very small (9px) through very large (24px) — with the
                                recommended default of medium set at 16px.
                                If you change one of those settings in your browser, ideally all your fonts will scale
                                up (or down) proportionately in reference to the size of that font setting. Ideally,
                                that is, if you’re using relative CSS units. This browser font size adjustment won’t
                                have any effect on typography that uses pixels for font-size and/or the line-height.
                                This brings us to the much-needed example.

                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>✔ using relative CSS units rather than relying solely on pixels really bumps up the
                                reading
                                experience in a low vision scenario.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <article>
                <p>Sixteen pixel is the default font size which means if it is not overwitten by being specified on
                    the css or changed from the default browser setting as mentioned on the above blog, the text
                    size becomes 16 pixel. So when the font is set to 200px, the font size is no longer the default
                    HTML font(16px), it is overwritten to 200px</p>
