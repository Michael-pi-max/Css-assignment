                                Browsers are getting better and better with lots of additional features. Earlier version
                                of browsers
                                had limited features, static websites were popular back then. As browser features
                                matured, relative
                                css units came into existence to meet the needs of changing window sizes.it was clear to
                                choose
                                between pixel and relative style until this point. But the introduction of browser
                                zooming created
                                argument among web developers on the relevance of using pixel over relative style to
                                achieve
                                responsive website.
                            </p>
                            <h4>what is browser zooming?</h4>

                            <p>
                                Browser zooming technically is, when the user zooms the page in a modern browser,
                                everything scales
                                up or down proportionally.If there is browser zooming feature to accommodate the changes
                                when the
                                view port is changed. Is relative style still worthy is the main debating point.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h4>Those who reside in using pixel</h4> <br>
                            “Browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don’t have to convert our typography to
                            relative units in CSS. Users don’t bother to adjust the font display settings in the
                            browser,
                            our work is done here!” <br><br>
                            Values defined in pixels make maintenance of code more straightforward. It also makes code
                            more
                            portable as styles can be dropped in to another project without potential sizing compounding
                            issues (em) or needing to adjust values due to different root font sizes (rem). <br> <br>
                            However, most importantly, pixels make working with designers day to day easier. Pixels
                            provide
                            a shared language between the worlds of developer and designer. This shared language makes
                            it
                            easy and accessible for anyone to jump in and change/tweak values in developer tools and get
                            predictable results.

                            <p>
                                “Yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there’s a difference between how the UI
                                appears
                                when
                                the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser size has been adjusted as
                                well.
                                Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so we need to account
                                for
                                that in our CSS declarations.” <br> <br>
                                If the world were an ideal place, we’d all use pixels. But it’s not, we have the broken
                                browser
                                to contend with. IE/Win will not allow readers to resize text that has been sized in
                                pixels.
                                Like it or not, your readers will want to resize text at some point. Perhaps they are
                                short-sighted, doing a presentation, using a ridiculously high resolution laptop or
                                simply
                                have
                                tired eyes. So unless you know (not think) your audience won’t be using IE/Win or will
                                never
                                wish to resize their text then pixels are not yet a viable solution.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This guideline states that all website text must be resizable (zoomable). This was more of a
                        problem
                        in
                        older browsers from around 2005 where browsers wouldn’t resize text sizes as pixels or points,
                        but
                        that
                        isn’t an issue anymore as all modern desktop browsers will trigger a full page zoom.</p>
                    <p>
                        Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to
                        200
                        percent without loss of content or functionality.</p>
                    <h4>my judgment</h4>
                    <p>To achieve responsivness after the emergence of zooming feature of browser, the effect of using
                        pixel
                        is becoming as effective as using relative styles. but I think there are cases where we should
                        prefer
                        one over the other. </p>

                    <p> ✔ As indicated above zooming feature makes pixels as effective as %, rem and em on
                        achieving
                        reponsive pages. but there is a condition that does not support this claim. The
                        above
                        claim is
                        stated true
                        provided that that users do <strong> not </strong> dig into the advanced browser
                        settings to
                        change their default font size.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ✔ A lesser known feature of most browsers, though, is the option to adjust your
                        preferred font size. This feature operates independently from the page zoom
                        feature.ranging from the very small (9px) through very large (24px),with the
                        recommended default of medium set at 16px.
                        If you change one of those settings in your browser, ideally all your fonts will
                        scale
                        up (or down) proportionately in reference to the size of that font setting. Ideally,
                        that is, if you’re using relative CSS units. This browser font size adjustment won’t
                        have any effect on conditions that uses pixels for font-size.
                    </p>

                    <p>✔ using relative CSS units rather than relying solely on pixels really bumps up the
                        reading
                        experience in a low vision scenario. The user might want to adjust the font size of the browser
                        setting without changing the zoom if his vision is low or if he is teaching using a projector on
                        this cases relative styles are better</p>

                    <p>Sixteen pixel is the default font size which means if it is not overwitten by being specified on

                        size becomes 16 pixel. So when the font is set to 200px, the font size is no longer the default

                <p class="title">Css3 Technical additions</p>
                <article>
                    <p> The main difference between CSS and CSS3 is that CSS3 offers new features and separates CSS into
                        convenient modules.</p>

                    <h3>
                        1.CSS3 Selectors
                    </h3>
                    <p>CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class, and/or ID. CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements,
                        pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a
                        wide
                        range of selectors.
                        CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors. These allow for matching elements based on their
                        attributes. CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors.Three more attribute selectors were
                        added in
                        CSS3; they allow for substring selection.</p>

                    <h3>2. Pseudo-classes</h3>
                    <p>
                        It’s likely that you’re already familiar with some of the user interaction pseudo-classes,namely
                        :link, :visited, :hover, :active, and :focus.
                        A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector, which allows
                        designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it would be <html>. Since :root
                        is generic, it allows a designer to select the root element of an XML document without
                        necessarily knowing it’s name.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. CSS3 Colors</h3>
                    <p>CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . Prior to CSS3, we almost
                        always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also
                        possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or
                        percentages.
                        The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional
                        keyword
                        colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other
                        options:
                        HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to
                        declare
                        semitransparent colors. </p>
                    <h3>4. Rounded Corners: border-radius </h3>
                    <p> The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or
                        additional
                        markup. To add rounded corners to our box, we simply add
                        border-radius: 25px; </p>

                    <h3>5. Drop Shadows</h3>
                    <p>CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This
                        property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner
                        and/or
                        outer drop shadows on your elements.
                        box-shadow: 2px 5px 0 0 rgba(72,72,72,1);</p>

                    <h3>6. Text Shadow</h3>
                    <p>text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes. Prior to CSS 3, this would be
                        done
                        by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it.
                        text-shadow: topOffset leftOffset blurRadius color;</p>

                    <h3>7. Linear Gradients </h3>
                    <p> The syntax for generating linear gradients with CSS3 is added.</p>

                    <h3>8. Opacity</h3>
                    <p> One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent.
                        For instance, you can apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level
                        depends
                        on the indicated values.</p>
                    <h3>9. Font Additions</h3>
                    <p> Adding fonts is super easy in CSS 3, all you need to do is just upload the file to your server,
                        link
                        to the CSS file and add fonts as per your choice.</p>
